## About the project
This project was part of my coursework at KYH, designed to enhance both teamwork and technical skills. The course was structured in two phases. 
In the first phase, as a group of three, we selected a target audience to develop an Airbnb clone for, conducting various forms of research including interviews and creating user personas. 
Together, we then translated our findings into a collaborative Figma design. The second phase focused on the implementation, 
where I independently developed the project using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
